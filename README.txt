This CIS TOOLKIT is intended only for Standalone instances of Windows and not intended for computers joined to a domain.  The toolkit will work on both, but domain joined computers should be managed from Group Policy and not by locally applied policies. This tool will modify the registry of your system and should be run at the userâ€™s own risk.  The Center for Internet Security assumes no responsibility for issues that this tool may cause.  Please make sure that the remediation kit you are applying contain the settings you would like to apply before applying any settings.  Please make a backup prior to making any changes.
